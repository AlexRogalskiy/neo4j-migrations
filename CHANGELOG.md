# 1.4.0

*No breaking changes*.  The version is bumped due to a couple of new features that required additional API, for example using only remote or locally discovered migrations.

A big "Thank you" goes out to @marianozunino, a long time Neo4j (and Spring Data Neo4j) user, who created his own refactor tooling dubbed [Morpheus](https://github.com/marianozunino/morpheus). We worked together so that this and his tooling use the same meta model. And afterwards, I took some inspiration from the features he had in Morpheus.

The feature I like the most in this release is the new and shiny integration with Quarkus dev-services, check it out: [Dev Services integration](https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/1.4.0/#devservicesintegration).

# 1.3.0

Happy 2nd birthday, _neo4j-migrations_! ü•≥ The first pre-release, 0.0.1 has been pushed out to central on January 9th, 2020. Since than, stuff has come a long way and I am super happy about it.

1.3.0 is a big release coming only 4 days after the last one [(1.2.3](https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/tag/1.2.3)) and bumping the minor number. Why is that? 
The API hasn't changed in an incompatible way, but there are 2 changes in behavior

1. 2afaaa5 aligns the behavior of the `enabled` flag in the Spring Boot starter with the behavior in the Quarkus extension: A bean of type `Migrations` will be provided in the application context regardless of that setting. You are free to use it any way you want. You might want to make sure your application is on a valid database or not without us applying the migrations. Or you just want to use the `info` api to get the current version
2. c98d757 makes `locations-to-scan` and `packages-to-scan` [Build Time configuration](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#build-time-configuration), meaning they are evaluated at built respectively augmentation time. This allows to finally complete the feature I had on my list since forever [("Add a Quarkus extension")](https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/issues/8) in full: Delivered with c10c4468 in 1.2.2 for the first time, it is now fully supported (and tested) in natively distributed Quarkus applications as well and with that, feature complete. If you want (or need) file based locations outside an augmented application, please use the new `external-locations`. It supports only file-based locations, does not become part of the image and is changeable without re-augmentation.

## üöÄ Features
- 20f27d3 Compress native CLI binaries. (#372)
- b67fcc0 Add `apply` alias for `migrate` to the CLI.
- c98d757 Support classpath scanning in Quarkus native image.
- 2afaaa5 Allow disabling of migrations in Spring Boot without removing the `Migrations` bean. (#361)

## üîÑÔ∏è Refactorings
- ccd6461 Fail early with `classpath://` locations passed to the CLI in native image. (#369)
- 62278f2 Make sure that all sessions handed out use the latest bookmarks known. (#370)
- 3923423 Use transaction functions for all interactions with Neo4j inside the core module. (#365)
- a3422a8 Replace `MigrationsInitializer` in Quarkus extension with ServiceStartBuildItem.
- 4ad5dd0 Use List.sort instead of Collections.

## üìù Documentation
- 6a5ca16 Improve core JavaDocs.

## üõ† Build
- 356fa46 Add end-to-end test for the native CLI. (#371)
- 5ffda5c Use official GraalVM action for releasing. (#366)
- 2c96895 Define a stable order for categories in the changelog.

# 0.3.2

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.


# 0.3.1

## üöÄ Features

- GH-238 - Add autocrlf option.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix logging on native image.

## üßπ Housekeeping

- GH-239 - Use transaction functions instead of auto commits where applicable.
- Don't print full stacktrace on auth error.
- Set pool size to 1 in CLI. [improvement]
 
Java and native binaries are now published with each GitHub-Release.


# 0.2.1

## üöÄ Features

* GH-237 - Add `validateOnMigrate` to skip validation of migration-checksums.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

* GH-232 - Treat single `\r` as correct line endings.

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.

Noteworthy: Upgraded the example using Neo4j Test-Harness to Neo4j *4.3.2*. Neo4j requires JDK 11, so this project requires now JDK 11 to **build** but **still targets JDK 8**, so that it can be used with Java 8. I do think that this change in the build justifies a minor version bump alone but we have also a new configuration option, hence the 0.2.1 version.

Thanks to @AndreasBoehme for his input on this release!


# 0.1.4

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.

Noteworthy: Upgraded to Spring Boot 2.5.0.


# 0.1.3

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot.

Especially the upgrade to Classgraph 4.8.103 has to be mentioned, as that fixes a resource scanning issue.


# 0.1.2

## üöÄ Features

* GH-159 - Add support for more flexible version schemes in migration names (thanks to @katya-dovgalets)

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot


# 0.1.1

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Tons of dependency updates thanks to @dependabot
* The Spring Boot Starter has been updated to Spring Boot 2.4 and thus doesn't require the custom Neo4j driver starter anymore!  üéâ


# 0.0.13

Neo4j-Migrations didn't work on instances with anonymous access due to the fact the user management procedures will be removed in such an instance.


# 0.0.9

## üßπ Housekeeping

* Easier use of the starter: Starter for driver is a non-optional dependency for the starter and stays optional for the auto configuration itself, so that people have choice whether to include it or not.


# 0.0.8

## üöÄ Features

* Spring Boot starter added with instructions

## üö®Api changes

* Renamed prefix `filesystem:` to `file:` to be consistent with most other tools out there. 

*NOTE:* There are 0.0.6 and 0.0.7 on central, but without the starter due to issues with Maven's release plugin, the Nexus plugin and submodules with a different parent. I'm sorry for that.
