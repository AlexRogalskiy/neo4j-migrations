[abstract]
--
This is a tool for defining Java based migrations that should be applied and recorded against a Neo4j instance.
The only dependencies are the Neo4j Java driver and https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[ClassGraph], the later being used to find migrations on the classpath.
--

== Usage

Declare the extension as Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Put your migrations as Java classes into your project:

[source,java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;

import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.JavaBasedMigration;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

	@Override
	public void apply(Driver driver) {
		// Steps necessary for a migration
	}
}
